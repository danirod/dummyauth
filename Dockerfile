# This is the Dockerfile for dummyauth.
#
# This is my first Dockerfile for a Python project.
# Things will get better eventually. Bug reports with
# performance suggestions are welcomed.
#
# This Dockerfile is based on Alpine Linux to favour a lightweight image size.
# Because this is a container, the dependencies declared in the Pipfile are
# installed systemwise. uWSGI is installed to act as an WSGI server.
